The latest member of the development team at work reminds me of myself when I was new to the development scene. I'll see him mulling over a bit of code or system issue that from his point of view *should* work, yet does not. This usually leads him to the conclusion that the system is preforming some kind of unknown Vudo and that there is in fact nothing really wrong. This is believed in spite of the the fact he is getting incorrect results. The truth is, and I came to this conclusion only thru experience; there is no Vudo. The effect does in fact have a cause. You only have to follow the effect to it's logical source now matter in-conceivable the cause could be, it does have a cause; you have only to find it. The skill you gain from this experience is the ability to diagnose the cause sooner than the guy next to you.
