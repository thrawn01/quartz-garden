While browsing through some old chat logs I found this little gem
```
brian: hey, please make sure to turn on updatedb in your build script.
thrawn01: should be on by default, but I'll check.
** I sent some messages confirming it is on as default on the new boxes **
brian: life is filled with mystery
thrawn01: That is just a nice way of saying u were mistaken
brian: so, your theory is that someone went to prod4 and sat-svn1 and turned it off?
thrawn01: ninjas
brian: stealthy root ninjas. very likely
thrawn01: indeed.
```
I also found a qoute from stephen hawking

```
"The whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do
 not happen in an arbitrary manner, but that they reflect a certain
underlying order, which may or may not be divinely inspired"
```
 
I find that I would have to agree.
