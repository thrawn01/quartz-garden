There is so much stuff on the internet which can easily confuse developers who are new to Domain Driven Design. So I created this page as a jumping off point that I can point new devs too.

First read my article [[Anatomy Of A Product]] to get an idea of WHY DDD is an important skill to learn.

Next watch this presentation by [Micheal Plod](https://twitter.com/bitboss)

Finally go get lost in the [ddd-crew](https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process) repo, that should keep you busy for a while, come back when you have questions. ðŸ¤ª
