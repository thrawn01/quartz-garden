### Things I Believe
* You can have strong opinions but, donâ€™t hold them too close to your heart.
* You should never guess, always inspect, measure, and then act.
* If your entire focus is on code, you will get beautiful code, but a poor product.
*  Everyone has value, some just havenâ€™t seen it yet, Itâ€™s our job to help them see it.
* If you donâ€™t have a strategy for handling technical debt you are doomed to lose velocity over the life of your product.
* The key isnâ€™t finding the perfect product, so much as it is figuring out the method for making successful products.
* The point of a debate is to argue a position, the point of a conversation is to exchange ideas. One is productive, the other is not. Life is too short to argue with those who only wish to debate, but not educate.
* Two much power concentrated in a single person is detrimental to humanity.
*  My favorite childhood memory is my back not hurting.

And finally, Donâ€™t take any one thing to seriously, including this.

### Things I've Worked On
I'm currently working on an open source based communication startup which is currently in stealth mode.

I helped lead the engineering department at [mailgun.com](https://mailgun.com), and previously worked at [Rackspace](https://rackspace.com) where I helped launch and operate the Cloud Block Storage product. See [[about|About Me]] page for details.
